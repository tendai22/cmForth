       Here we assume that there is only a RS-232 interface to the outside world.  As with any other computer language for serious programming activity, one or more disk drives are necessary to store source code and data.  A serial disk is thus designed to make the maximum utilization of the available serial communication line.  The serial disk requires a host computer at the other end of the RS-232 line to act as the terminal and disk server for this Forth system.  Whenever a disk block is requested, the data will be transferred into the Forth system through the serial link.  When an updated block is flushed back to the disk, the data is also sent through the serial link.

5.1.   Disk Buffer Manager
       Two disk buffers are maintained in the cmFORTH system.  Each buffer is 1024 cells long.  The first buffer starts at memory address 800H and the second buffer is at C00H under the ROM memory.  Two cells in BUFFERS array contain the block numbers associated with the data stored in the two buffers.  The pointer PREV, points to the disk buffer which was referenced most recently.  OLDEST points to the disk buffer least used.
       In this system, two disk buffers are assigned and numbered as 0 or 1.  Two entries in the BUFFERS array are used to store block numbers corresponding to the contents of the two buffers.  Two variables PREV and OLDEST determined which of the two buffers is the most recently accessed.  The manager always looks at the PREV block when a block is requested.  If the block is not in the PREV buffer, it will exchange PREV with OLDEST and look at the PREV block again.  If the requested block is in one of the two buffers, that buffer will certainly become the PREV buffer and no disk access will be necessary.  If the requested block is not in these buffers, the manager will assign the PREV buffer to the new block; and the old data in this buffer which must be the least recently referenced block will be flushed to the disk or discarded.
       This technique is often referred to as the Ping-Pong buffers.  The two buffers are used in the most efficient fashion.

5.2.   Disk Read and Write
       The serial disk is implemented using a very simple protocol.  A disk read/write request is initiated by sending a NUL byte to the host at the other end of the RS-232 line, followed by two more bytes identifying the disk block requested.  High byte of the block number is send first.  If the most significant bit in the high byte is set to 1, it is a disk write command.  1024 bytes will then be transmitted to the host.  Then it will wait for a key from the keyboard to confirm the termination of transmission.  If the MSB in the high byte is reset, it is a read command and the host is expected to send 1024 bytes of the requested block.

6.   The Text Interpreter
       The text interpreter is the operating system  of Forth and it is the user interface which allows a user to operate the computer interactively.  What the text interpreter does is very simple.  It accepts a line of commands from the terminal, parses out words in the command line and executes them in the order given.  It only has to deal with two types of words, Forth commands which had been compiled into the dictionary and numbers as 16 bit integers.  If the interpreter finds a word in the dictionary, it will execute that word.  If the word is not defined in the dictionary, text interpreter will try to convert it into an integer and push the integer on the stack.  If it fails to convert the word into a number, the word is outside of the computer's vocabulary and it will abort the command line.  It will then come back and ask the user to type another command line and the process continues on for ever.
       The major functions performed by the text interpreter are receiving command lines, parsing words, dictionary searches, command execution, and number conversion.  We have already discussed number conversion and user input functions.  Here we shall discuss the rest of the functions and how they are tied together to form a complete operating system.

                             in bytes.  Terminate the copying
                             when a delimiter is detected.

6.2.   Dictionary Search
       With the NC4000 chip, the code field and the parameter fields in a regular Forth system must be merged into a single field, as the inner interpreters NEXT, NEST ( DOCOL ), and UNNEST ( ;S ) are all taken care of by hardware.  A word defined in this system thus consists of three fields:  a link field, a name field, and the code/parameter field.  The bit arrangements in the name field can be shown as follows:
 
       r0sn nnnn tccc cccc             r: remote bit
       0ccc cccc 0ccc cccc             s: smudge bit
               ...                     n: character count
               ...                     t: truncation bit
       0ccc cccc tccc cccc             c: ASCII character
 
The truncation bit in the last cell of the name field indicates to the text interpreter that a long name is truncated and name comparison must stop at that cell.
       The dictionary contains two vocabularies, FORTH and COMPILER.  The link field addresses  of the last words in these vocabularies are stored in an array, immediately prior to the system variable CONTEXT.  Each cell in this array contains a pointer, pointing to the link field of the last word defined in the corresponding vocabulary.  Each link field contains a pointer pointing to the link field of the previously defined word.  The other end of the thread is the first word in the linked chain, whose link field contains a zero as the end-of-link indicator.  To locate a word in a vocabulary, the link field address is first obtained from the BUFFERS array in front of CONTEXT.  Then the linked chain is followed to see if the parsed string can match a name in that vocabulary.
