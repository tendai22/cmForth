# CHAPTER I.   THE NOVIX NC4000 CHIP
 
## 1.   Historical Background

In the beginning, Chuck Moore invented Forth as a programming language to make himself a more productive programmer.  It was in the late 1960's when various aspects of Forth were developed and integrated into a single, unified, and complete software development tool and environment.  In 1972, Chuck and a few of his colleagues left National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NARO) where they nurture Forth into its present form, and formed Forth, Inc. to explore its commercial applications.  For a while, he was content to use Forth as a software tool to solve real world problems, while leaving it to the hardware engineers to pick up the Forth architecture and implement Forth engines.

Forth didn't become a household name in computer circles until Forth Interest Group was formed in the San Francisco Bay area, which distributed fig-Forth source code by the ton at cost, beginning in 1978.  Although Forth had established a sizable following in the microcomputer user community, the microcomputer industry was very slow in accepting Forth as an architecture for hardware design and implementation.  There were scattered efforts toward building Forth engines using bit slice technology and random logic, but the consequence was almost nil.  Meanwhile, Chuck became restive and took it upon himself the task of casting Forth into silicon.  In 1980, Chuck left Forth, Inc. to pursuit his new dream.

In the reorganization, Forth, Inc. expanded its board of directors to include Bill Ragsdale, the founding father of Forth Interest Group, and John Peers of Logical Machines, Both of them had very intense interest in seeing Forth put into hardware.  The right mix of personality was thus gathered for the precise chemistry necessary for brewing a Forth chip.

At that time, Chuck was designing a prototype board which would execute Forth words as primitive instructions with Glenn Haydon and others.  The spark that initiate the Forth chip development was set by Don Colburn of Creative Solutions, another Forth heavy weight player on the east coast.  With a $1000 birthday gift from his wife, Don organized a one-day, project-oriented session with Chuck Moore, Bill Ragsdale and a chip designer to discuss the feasibility of building a Forth engine on silicon.  The discussions affirmed for Chuck that his dream of Forth chip could be realized and that others were serious in their support of his idea.

John Peers saw the beauty of approaching Forth from several levels.  He founded Technology Industries in March 1981, to be a parent organization to develop Forth in hardware, software, and applications.  With funding from the Technology Industries, Chuck developed and demonstrated a Forth engine simulator with color CRT display of the internal data paths and operations in March 1983.  A funding partner of the technology Industries, Sysorex International, became interested in the project and formed the Novix partnership in March 1984 to carry forward the hardware implementation of the Forth chip.

Mostek was chosen as the foundary to cast Forth in silicon.  The chip is implemented with the 3 micron HCMOS process using 4000 gates.  It was packaged in a 128 pin pin-grid array.  The first working chip was delivered in March 1985, running at 8 MHz.  It was supposed to be a prototype chip.  Since 95% of the functions worked as designed, Novix decided to offer it as a product and called it NC4000P.  An evaluation and development system named Beta Board was also offered by Novix.

As Mostek was sold to Thomson, and Novix went through a reorganization and incorporation process, efforts in removing the bugs in the prototype mask was suspended.  A second run using the same prototype mask was produced, with the pin count on the pin-grid package reduced to 121 pins.  It seems that this prototype chip, complete with all the bugs and restrictions, will be the one we have to live with for a while.  Even with these bugs and restrictions, NC4000P is more powerful than the best of the 16-bit microprocessors built by very reputable manufacturers.

As of March 1986, Novix has incorporated with Mr. John Peers as its chairman and chief executive officer.  It is producing NC4000 chips and selling them.  Chuck Moore is offering the Gamma Board, a kit with a bare PC board, a NC4000 chip and a pair of PROM--to people who like to build computers.  Software Composers are selling board level products: SC1000C single board computer with NC4000 and 8K of RAM, prototyping PC boards, memory expansion boards, etc.  As the chip becomes available, we shall see more products and manufacturers using this chip in various fields for different applications.
